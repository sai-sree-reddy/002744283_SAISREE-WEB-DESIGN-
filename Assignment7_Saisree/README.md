Functions: 
Functions allow you to define complex operations on SassScript values that you can re-use throughout your stylesheet.
A function has been defined to change the text color based on the background color. 
The fuctions are demonstarted in _functions.scss.

Variables:
Variables are used to store a value in a name and use the name everywhere instead of bringing the value everytime.
Some of the variables are for storing colors.
Several variables have been used in the _variables.scss.

Nesting:
Sass will let you nest your CSS selectors in a way that follows the same visual hierarchy of your HTML. 
Nesting has been implemented at several locations like about section.
Refer to style.scss for samples.

These are leveraged for changing text format in this assignment like for 'p' tag in about, menu, contact sections. (graph-text mixin)

Interpolation:
Interpolation can be used almost anywhere in a Sass stylesheet to embed the result of a SassScript expression into a chunk of CSS.
Just wraping an expression in #{} in any place.
We used it for text-decoration property as it is lengthy and used at multiple places.
The Mixins are demonstrated in style.scss
