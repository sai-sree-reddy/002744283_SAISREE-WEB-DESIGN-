Web Design and User Experience Engineering

Assignment 1

Part A : Eat Fit

It is a website for user to view the services like Meditation, Yoga, Food and Spa provided by wellness by Eat Fit.
The site lands on the Home Page, which previews the services and navigates to two other pages,
- JOIN US : a form to enter details to join.
- CONTACT US : a table which provides the location details and links to their email.

Tags used - 
~ Favicon - It adds an image/icon to the title of the page in the browser tab.
~ <form> - It is used to create a form for the user input. I have used <label> and <input> tags to create a form for users to enter their details to join the NU Wellness community.
~ <table> - It creates a table in the HTML page. I have used <tr>, <th> and <td> tags to create a table which contains the location details and links to the representative's email.
	- <tr> defines rows.
	- <th> defines table header.
	- <td> defines table cells.
~ <header> - It works as container for the introduction of page. I used it to preview the page icon and page name. 
~ <footer> - It defines the footer section of the HTML page. I have used it to provide phone number and email of NU Wellness.
~ <nav> - It defines a section for navigation links. I have used it for navbar to link all 3 pages, i.e. About, Join Us, Contact Us.
~ <style> - It is used to define the required css of the elements in the HTML page.
~ <img> - It is used to link an image to the HTML page. I have used .gif and .jpg for images and background-image.
~ <a> - Hyperlink - Used to define a hyperlink. the 'href' attribute in <a> is used to indicate the link's destination. I have used it,
	- in the navbar to link all 3 pages.
	- in table to link to the representative's email from the default mail app.
~ <button> - It defines a button. I have used it in main page at the bottom to link the button to the JOIN US HTML page.
~ <br> - It is used to break the line and move to the next line.
